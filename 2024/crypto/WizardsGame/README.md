# Description

In a dimly lit room at the heart of an enchanted castle, a cryptic board sits before you. The pieces, though unfamiliar, seem to follow a peculiar set of rules — their movements deliberate, as if each step reveals a hidden code. You are reminded of a magical moment in history, a game played not with wands but with wit, where a trio of friends faced the impossible.

Here, it's not just about your next move, but how well you can read between the lines. A single slip could cost you everything, but decoding the pattern may unlock a deeper truth. Can you uncover the cipher hidden within this age-old game before time runs out?

“Sometimes, the greatest secrets are found in the simplest of moves.”
