# Description

My friend said they are going to make an insane new crypto challenge and I have to solve it but.. I hate crypto ðŸ˜­

I saw them making a flag but didn't catch the text. When they left room I tried to open the file but they password protected it?! I can't believe they wouldn't trust me around their computer like that!! ðŸ˜¤

Anyway, I figured I'd take a snapshot to have a better look later.. Maybe you can help?
