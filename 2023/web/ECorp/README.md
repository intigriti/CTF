# Description

Neurotap is an emerging corporation that produces brain-machine interfaces boasting about privacy, security and clients well-being.

But word got out that their implants are actually malicious in nature, stealing their clients data straight from their brains, running ads in their dreams and even manipulating their victims' thoughts to manipulate elections, buy items they don't need and convince everyone they know to buy a Neurotap as well. They must be stopped before they "infect" too many people...

Our intel says that they have an entire C2 dashboard exposed on their clearnet website, and they had recently started migrating back-end architecture. If we're lucky, they might've rushed things and made some mistakes! Find a way to erase all their data and deactivate the Neurotaps safely.
